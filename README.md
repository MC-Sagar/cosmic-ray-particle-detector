# Cosmic Ray Particle Detector


Cosmic Ray Particle Detector built using OpenCV-Python for detecting Cosmic Ray Particles

## Description

The software can be implemented in a Raspberry Pi placed in a high altitude weather balloon to detect the primary cosmic rays above the earth atmosphere. Raspberry Pi Camera will be connected to Raspberry Pi wherein the camera lens will be covered with black insulation tape so whenever there is a cosmic ray hit it will be detected by camera sensors and the images of cosmic ray hits will be stored on local storage.


### Hardware Requirements

* Raspberry Pi
* Raspberry Pi Camera V2
* 3D Printed CubeSat (optional)

### Installation

Raspberry Pi should have OpenCV(v3 and above) and Imutils installed.

```sh
$ cd projectFolder
$ python3 start.py
```
